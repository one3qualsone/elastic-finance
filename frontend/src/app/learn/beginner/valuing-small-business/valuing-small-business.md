# Valuing a Small Business

Understanding how to value a business is an essential skill for any investor. By breaking down the components of a business and analyzing how money flows through it, we can determine its true worth.

## The Small Business Model

Every business, regardless of size, consists of three key components:

1. **Owner(s)**: The person or people who own the business
2. **Business**: The entity that produces goods or services
3. **Customers**: The people who purchase those goods or services

To illustrate this concept, let's use a simple example of an ice cream stand owned by Nancy. Nancy doesn't work at the stand herself—she hires employees to manage everything and simply receives the profits.

This model is important because it mirrors how stock ownership works. When you own stock, you're an owner who doesn't actively work in the business but is entitled to a portion of the profits.

## How Money Flows Through a Business

Let's track money flow through Nancy's ice cream stand over the course of a year:

1. **Total Revenue**: $100,000 (money customers spend)
2. **Costs**:
   - Employee wages: $20,000
   - Materials (ingredients, cups, etc.): $40,000
   - Rent/property costs: $10,000
3. **Income Before Taxes**: $30,000 ($100,000 - $70,000)
4. **Taxes**: $10,000
5. **Net Income/Earnings**: $20,000

## Net Income: The Critical Figure

The $20,000 net income (also called earnings) is the most important figure in this analysis. This represents the money left after all expenses and taxes—the actual profit that belongs to the owner.

Once Nancy has this $20,000 in net income, she has two options:
- Pay herself (dividends)
- Reinvest in the business (retained earnings)

She can also do a combination of both—perhaps keeping $10,000 for herself and putting $10,000 back into the business.

## Small vs. Large Business Comparison

This same model applies to businesses of all sizes:

**Small Business**:
- Owner: Single person (Nancy)
- Business: Simple operation (ice cream stand)
- Customers: Local patrons

**Large Business**:
- Owners: Shareholders (represented by Board of Directors)
- Business: Complex operation with many employees (led by CEO)
- Customers: Potentially global

The principles of valuation remain consistent regardless of business size.

## Valuing a Business: The Basics

Now let's determine what Nancy's business is worth based on its financials:

- Annual net income: $20,000
- If someone bought the business for $400,000, they would get a 5% return ($20,000 ÷ $400,000)
- If purchased for $200,000, they would get a 10% return
- If purchased for $100,000, they would get a 20% return

## The Key Insight: Price vs. Return

Notice that the business itself doesn't change in any of these scenarios. It still generates $20,000 in net income regardless of the purchase price. However, the investor's return changes dramatically based on what they pay.

This illustrates the most fundamental principle of value investing: **Your return is determined not by the quality of the business alone, but by the price you pay for it.**

If you overpay for even the best business, your returns will be poor. If you purchase a solid business at a significant discount to its intrinsic value, your returns can be excellent.

## The Investor's Challenge

The challenge for any investor is determining the true value of a business and then having the discipline to only purchase when the price is right. This requires:

1. Understanding how to analyze financial statements
2. Calculating a reasonable intrinsic value
3. Waiting patiently for the right price
4. Having the courage to act when others are fearful

By mastering the fundamentals of business valuation, you'll be equipped to make smarter investment decisions—whether you're evaluating a small local business or shares in a multinational corporation.
