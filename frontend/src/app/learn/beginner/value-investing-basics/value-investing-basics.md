# What is Value Investing?

Value investing is an investment philosophy that focuses on purchasing assets for less than their intrinsic value. Made famous by legends like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, this approach emphasises patient, long-term thinking over short-term speculation.

## Value Investing vs. Value Trading

To understand value investing, let's contrast it with value trading through a simple example:

Imagine Kyle, who started with a simple red paperclip and traded up through progressively more valuable items until he eventually owned a house. Each time Kyle made a trade, he sought something of higher value. But here's the key distinction:

**Value Trading**: When Kyle held the fish pen he traded his paperclip for, did the fish pen become more valuable during the time he held it? No—it maintained its value but didn't generate additional income.

**Value Investing**: Unlike trading items, value investing involves buying assets that not only maintain value but continue to put money in your pocket while you hold them.

## Assets vs. Liabilities

Understanding the difference between assets and liabilities is fundamental to value investing:

- **Assets**: Put money into your pocket (income-producing rental property, dividend-paying stocks, etc.)
- **Liabilities**: Take money out of your pocket (consumer debt, depreciating goods, etc.)

Wealthy people focus on accumulating assets while minimising liabilities. Poor people often do the opposite, acquiring liabilities while holding few income-producing assets beyond their job.

## The Warren Buffett Approach

When Warren Buffett practices value investing, he follows this process:

1. **Analyse Intrinsic Value**: He examines a company's financial data to determine what he thinks it's actually worth (e.g., $40 per share)
2. **Compare to Market Price**: Only after valuing the company does he look at its market price (e.g., $30 per share)
3. **Buy at a Discount**: If the market price is significantly below his calculated intrinsic value, he purchases the stock
4. **Hold for Income**: While owning the company, he receives income through dividends or increasing value

Buffett doesn't concern himself with short-term market fluctuations. His focus is on the company's actual business performance and intrinsic value.

## The Origins of Value Investing

Warren Buffett learned the fundamentals of value investing from his Columbia professor, Benjamin Graham, often called the "Godfather of Value Investing." Graham wrote two influential books:

- **Security Analysis** (1934)
- **The Intelligent Investor** (1949)

Buffett attributes much of his investment knowledge to these works, though they're not beginner-friendly texts. That's why educational resources that translate these complex ideas into accessible formats are so valuable.

## Key Principles of Value Investing

1. **Focus on intrinsic value**, not market price
2. **Margin of safety** - buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value
3. **Long-term perspective** - hold quality investments for years or decades
4. **Business analysis** over market analysis
5. **Emotional discipline** - avoid following market hysteria in either direction

## Key Terms

- **Value Investing**: Buying assets for less than their intrinsic value
- **Assets**: Items that put money in your pocket
- **Liabilities**: Items that take money out of your pocket
- **Intrinsic Value**: The actual worth of an asset based on its fundamental characteristics

Value investing isn't about getting rich quickly—it's about growing wealth steadily and reliably over time by making intelligent investment decisions based on fundamental analysis rather than market sentiment.

## Key Valuation Metrics

These ratios help investors quickly identify potential opportunities that warrant deeper analysis.

## Market Cycles and Psychology

One of the most important aspects of value investing is understanding market psychology and cycles:

Value investors use these market cycles to their advantage, buying quality assets when fear is high and prices are low.
