# Calculating Intrinsic Value

Intrinsic value is the cornerstone concept of value investing. It represents what a business is truly worth based on its fundamental characteristics—not what the market says it's worth on any given day. Warren Buffett has built his extraordinary investing career on his ability to calculate intrinsic value and buy businesses when they trade significantly below that value.

## What is Intrinsic Value?

Intrinsic value is the actual worth of a business based on its:
- Earnings power
- Assets and liabilities
- Growth prospects
- Competitive advantages
- Management quality

Unlike market price, which changes constantly due to market sentiment, intrinsic value changes slowly as a company's fundamental characteristics evolve.

As Benjamin Graham famously stated:

> "In the short run, the market is a voting machine—tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is a weighing machine—assessing the substance of a company."

The goal of calculating intrinsic value is to determine the "substance" of a company, independent of market sentiment.

## Why Calculate Intrinsic Value?

Calculating intrinsic value serves several crucial purposes for investors:

1. **Provides a Benchmark**: It gives you a reference point against which to compare the current market price

2. **Creates Margin of Safety**: Knowing intrinsic value allows you to build in a cushion against errors in your calculations

3. **Removes Emotional Bias**: A structured valuation approach helps counter the psychological pitfalls of investing

4. **Enables Contrarian Decisions**: Having your own valuation gives you confidence to act contrary to market sentiment when appropriate

5. **Improves Long-Term Results**: Research consistently shows that buying assets below intrinsic value leads to superior long-term returns

## The Price-to-Value Relationship

The relationship between price and intrinsic value determines whether an investment is attractive:

- When Price < Intrinsic Value: Potentially attractive investment
- When Price = Intrinsic Value: Fairly valued investment
- When Price > Intrinsic Value: Potentially unattractive investment

The greater the discount to intrinsic value, the greater the potential return and margin of safety.

## Approaches to Calculating Intrinsic Value

There are several methods for calculating intrinsic value, each with its own strengths and limitations. Let's explore the most common approaches:

### 1. Earnings-Based Valuation

This approach values a company based on its earnings power. The simplest form is the P/E ratio method:

**Intrinsic Value = Earnings Per Share × Appropriate P/E Multiple**

For example, if a company earns $2 per share and you believe an appropriate P/E multiple is 15:
- Intrinsic Value = $2 × 15 = $30 per share

The challenge lies in determining an "appropriate" P/E multiple. Factors that influence this include:
- Growth rate
- Business stability
- Return on equity
- Debt levels
- Industry characteristics

A more sophisticated earnings-based approach is the **Earnings Power Value (EPV)** method:

**EPV = Adjusted Earnings ÷ Required Rate of Return**

For example, if a company has adjusted earnings of $2 per share and your required rate of return is 10%:
- EPV = $2 ÷ 0.10 = $20 per share

### 2. Book Value-Based Valuation

This approach focuses on a company's assets minus liabilities (equity). The simplest form is:

**Intrinsic Value = Book Value Per Share × Appropriate Multiple**

For quality businesses that generate high returns on equity, the appropriate multiple might be 1.5-3× book value. For average businesses, it might be closer to 1× book value.

A more sophisticated version is the **Net Asset Value (NAV)** method, which adjusts book value to reflect the current market value of assets and liabilities.

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

The DCF method values a company based on the present value of its expected future cash flows. It follows these steps:

1. Project future free cash flows for a forecast period (typically 5-10 years)
2. Calculate a terminal value representing all cash flows beyond the forecast period
3. Discount all these cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate
4. Sum these discounted values to arrive at intrinsic value

![DCF Model](/images/learn/dcf-model.svg)

The formula for DCF valuation is:

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{(1+r)^n}$$

Where:
- FCF_t = Free Cash Flow in year t
- r = Discount Rate
- n = Number of years in forecast period
- Terminal Value = FCF_n+1 ÷ (r - g), where g is the long-term growth rate

While DCF is theoretically the most sound valuation method, it requires numerous assumptions about future growth rates, margins, and appropriate discount rates.

### 4. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

For dividend-paying companies, the DDM values a stock based on the present value of expected future dividends:

**Intrinsic Value = D₁ ÷ (k - g)**

Where:
- D₁ = Expected dividend one year from now
- k = Required rate of return
- g = Expected dividend growth rate

For example, if a company is expected to pay a $1 dividend next year, your required return is 10%, and dividends are expected to grow at 6% annually:
- Intrinsic Value = $1 ÷ (0.10 - 0.06) = $1 ÷ 0.04 = $25 per share

### 5. Buffett's Owner Earnings Method

Warren Buffett prefers to use what he calls "owner earnings" to value a business:

**Owner Earnings = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures ± Working Capital Changes**

He then capitalizes these owner earnings using a rate that reflects long-term Treasury bond rates, plus a risk premium.

**Intrinsic Value = Owner Earnings ÷ Capitalization Rate**

## Building in a Margin of Safety

Regardless of which valuation method you use, it's essential to build in a margin of safety. As Benjamin Graham advised, never pay full intrinsic value for an investment—always insist on a discount to protect against:

1. Errors in your analysis
2. Unforeseen business challenges
3. Changes in the competitive landscape
4. Economic downturns
5. Bad luck

Most value investors look for at least a 25-50% discount to their calculated intrinsic value before investing.

## A Practical Example: Valuing a Fictional Company

Let's apply these concepts to value a fictional company, Quality Corp:

**Financial Data**:
- Earnings Per Share (EPS): $3.00
- Book Value Per Share: $25.00
- Free Cash Flow Per Share: $2.80
- Annual Dividend: $1.20
- Expected Growth Rate: 5%
- Current Market Price: $36.00

**Earnings-Based Valuation**:
If an appropriate P/E multiple is 12× (based on growth and stability):
- Intrinsic Value = $3.00 × 12 = $36.00

**Book Value-Based Valuation**:
If the company earns a 12% return on equity (above average):
- Intrinsic Value = $25.00 × 1.5 = $37.50

**DCF Valuation (Simplified)**:
Using a 9% discount rate and 5% growth:
- Intrinsic Value = $2.80 ÷ (0.09 - 0.05) = $2.80 ÷ 0.04 = $70.00

**Dividend Discount Model**:
- Intrinsic Value = $1.20 × 1.05 ÷ (0.09 - 0.05) = $1.26 ÷ 0.04 = $31.50

**Average of Methods**:
- ($36.00 + $37.50 + $70.00 + $31.50) ÷ 4 = $43.75

**Margin of Safety Assessment**:
With an average intrinsic value of $43.75 and a current market price of $36.00, the stock is trading at a:
- 17.7% discount to intrinsic value

If you require a 25% margin of safety, you might wait for the price to drop to around $32.80 before investing.

## Common Pitfalls in Intrinsic Value Calculation

When calculating intrinsic value, be aware of these common mistakes:

1. **Overconfidence in Projections**: Future growth and profitability are inherently uncertain

2. **Recency Bias**: Giving too much weight to recent performance

3. **Inadequate Discount Rate**: Failing to demand sufficient compensation for risk

4. **Ignoring Competitive Dynamics**: Not accounting for industry changes that could affect future profitability

5. **Overlooking Capital Allocation**: Ignoring how management uses cash flow

6. **Confirmation Bias**: Looking for data that confirms pre-existing opinions

## The Art and Science of Valuation

While intrinsic value calculation involves quantitative analysis, it also requires qualitative judgment about:

1. **Economic Moats**: How sustainable are the company's competitive advantages?

2. **Management Quality**: How well do executives allocate capital and create shareholder value?

3. **Industry Trends**: How will the business environment evolve over time?

4. **Reinvestment Opportunities**: Can the company deploy capital at attractive returns?

Warren Buffett emphasizes that intrinsic value calculation is not about achieving decimal-point precision but about being "approximately right rather than precisely wrong."

## Conclusion

Calculating intrinsic value is both an art and a science. It requires financial analysis, business judgment, and an understanding of economic principles. While no valuation method is perfect, the process of thoughtfully analyzing a business's fundamental characteristics provides a solid foundation for investment decisions.

By focusing on intrinsic value rather than market price, investors can:
- Make more rational investment decisions
- Avoid paying too much for popular stocks
- Find opportunities in undervalued, unpopular stocks
- Build a portfolio with a higher probability of long-term success

As Warren Buffett has demonstrated over decades, the combination of sound intrinsic value calculation and the patience to wait for attractive prices can lead to extraordinary investment results over time.
