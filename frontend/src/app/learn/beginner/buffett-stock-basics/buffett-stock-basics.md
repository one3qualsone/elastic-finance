# Warren Buffett Stock Basics

Warren Buffett is widely regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time. His straightforward approach to investing has helped him build a fortune exceeding $100 billion over decades of disciplined, patient investing. Let's explore the fundamental principles that guide his investment strategy.

## Buffett's Four Rules for Buying Stocks

Buffett follows four essential rules when evaluating potential investments. All four must be satisfied before he'll consider purchasing a stock:

### 1. The Stock Must Be Stable and Understandable

Buffett only invests in businesses he can understand and whose future earnings are reasonably predictable. He avoids:
- Companies with complex or constantly changing business models
- Businesses with highly unpredictable earnings
- Industries undergoing rapid technological disruption

He famously avoided tech stocks during the dot-com bubble, saying he didn't understand them well enough to predict their prospects 10-20 years into the future.

### 2. The Stock Must Have Long-Term Prospects

Buffett looks for businesses that will still be relevant and profitable decades from now. He asks:
- Will people still need this product or service in 30 years?
- Does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage?
- Is the industry likely to exist in its current form over the long term?

This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from compounding returns and minimize transaction costs and taxes.

### 3. The Stock Must Be Managed by Vigilant Leaders

Buffett places enormous importance on management quality, seeking executives who:
- Act like owners, not hired hands
- Allocate capital efficiently
- Are honest with shareholders
- Resist institutional imperatives to waste money
- Manage debt conservatively

While individual investors may not be able to meet with CEOs as Buffett does, they can assess management by studying shareholder letters, capital allocation decisions, and debt management practices.

### 4. The Stock Must Be Undervalued

Finally, even the best business isn't a good investment if the price is too high. Buffett determines a company's intrinsic value and only purchases when the market price offers a significant discount to that value.

## Basic Buffett Valuation Technique

During his early career working for Benjamin Graham, Buffett used a simple valuation method that combined earnings power and margin of safety:

### The Combined Ratio Method

This approach multiplies two key ratios to quickly assess if a stock deserves further analysis:

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Measures earnings power relative to price
2. **Price-to-Book Ratio**: Measures margin of safety

The formula:
P/E Ratio × Price-to-Book Ratio = Combined Ratio

Buffett and Graham considered stocks with a combined ratio below 22.5 potentially attractive, which can be derived from:
- P/E ratio of 15 or less
- Price-to-Book ratio of 1.5 or less

15 × 1.5 = 22.5

This simple screening tool helped identify stocks with both:
- Reasonable earnings power (P/E below 15)
- Decent margin of safety (Price-to-Book below 1.5)

While Buffett later evolved beyond this formula to incorporate qualitative factors and future growth, it remains a useful starting point for value-oriented stock screening.

## Buffett on Market Psychology

Buffett's perspective on the stock market differs dramatically from most investors:

> "I buy on the assumption that the stock market could close tomorrow and not reopen for another five years."

He views the market not as a guide to be followed but as a mechanism that occasionally offers opportunities to buy great businesses at attractive prices. Rather than trying to predict market movements, he focuses on:

1. Understanding business fundamentals
2. Calculating intrinsic value
3. Buying when prices fall significantly below that value
4. Holding for the long term, regardless of market fluctuations

## Patience and Individuality

Two key traits have defined Buffett's success:

### Patience

Buffett is willing to wait years for the right opportunity. As he says:

> "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."

He's comfortable holding cash for extended periods when attractive investments aren't available, rather than forcing money into mediocre opportunities.

### Independent Thinking

Perhaps most importantly, Buffett thinks independently and avoids following the crowd:

> "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

This contrarian mindset has allowed him to buy great businesses during market crashes and avoid overpriced assets during bubbles.

## Applying Buffett's Principles

While few investors will match Buffett's extraordinary success, his principles can guide anyone seeking to improve their investment results:

1. **Stay within your circle of competence** - invest in what you understand
2. **Think like a business owner**, not a stock trader
3. **Focus on value, not price movements**
4. **Be patient** - good investments are rare
5. **Think independently** - especially when market sentiment is extreme
6. **Prioritize quality businesses** over mediocre ones selling at slightly better prices

By applying these fundamental principles with discipline and patience, investors can improve their odds of achieving satisfactory long-term results while minimizing the risk of permanent capital loss.
