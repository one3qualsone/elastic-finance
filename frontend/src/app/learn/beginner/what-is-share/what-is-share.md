# What is a Share?

When investing in the stock market, you're actually buying ownership in real businesses. But what exactly is a share of stock? How does owning one share relate to owning an entire business? Understanding these concepts is essential for successful value investing.

## Breaking Down a Business into Shares

Let's continue with our ice cream stand example. Imagine Nancy wants to sell her business for $100,000, but she's having trouble finding a buyer for the entire operation. Instead, she decides to divide the business into smaller pieces that more people can afford.

Nancy splits her ice cream stand into 10,000 equal pieces (shares). Since the business is worth $100,000:

$100,000 ÷ 10,000 shares = $10 per share

Each share represents:
- 1/10,000th ownership of the entire business
- The right to 1/10,000th of the profits
- 1/10,000th of the voting power in business decisions

## Understanding Shares Outstanding

"Shares outstanding" refers to the total number of shares a company has been divided into. In our example, Nancy's ice cream stand has 10,000 shares outstanding.

For public companies like Apple or Microsoft, this number can be in the billions. If a company has 1 billion shares outstanding and you own 1,000 shares, you own 0.0001% of the entire business.

This number is crucial for calculating many important investment metrics.

## Comparing Whole Business vs. One Share Terminology

When analyzing businesses, terminology changes depending on whether you're looking at the entire company or a single share:

| Whole Business | One Share |
|----------------|-----------|
| Market Price (total) | Market Price (per share) |
| Net Income | Earnings Per Share (EPS) |
| Equity | Book Value Per Share |

For example:
- If Nancy's business has $20,000 in net income and 10,000 shares:
  - Earnings Per Share (EPS) = $2 ($20,000 ÷ 10,000)
- If the equity is $7,000:
  - Book Value Per Share = $0.70 ($7,000 ÷ 10,000)

## Basic Valuation Techniques for One Share

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the share price by the earnings per share:

P/E Ratio = Market Price Per Share ÷ Earnings Per Share

For Nancy's business:
- Market Price: $10 per share
- Earnings Per Share: $2
- P/E Ratio = 5 ($10 ÷ $2)

To interpret this number, use the following phrase:
"For every $5 I spend buying this stock, I should receive $1 in profit a year later."

The lower the P/E ratio, the better the apparent value (all else being equal).

### Price-to-Book Ratio

Similarly, the Price-to-Book ratio compares the market price to the book value per share:

Price-to-Book Ratio = Market Price Per Share ÷ Book Value Per Share

For Nancy's business:
- Market Price: $10 per share
- Book Value: $0.70 per share
- Price-to-Book Ratio = 14.3 ($10 ÷ $0.70)

This means:
"For every $14.30 I spend buying this stock, I'm getting $1 of equity."

A lower Price-to-Book ratio indicates a better margin of safety.

## The Power of Proportional Thinking

One of the most important insights is that the metrics for one share are directly proportional to those for the entire business. For Nancy's ice cream stand:

**Whole Business**:
- Market Price: $100,000
- Net Income: $20,000
- Expected Return: 20% ($20,000 ÷ $100,000)

**One Share**:
- Market Price: $10
- Earnings Per Share: $2
- Expected Return: 20% ($2 ÷ $10)

Whether you're buying one share or the entire business, the percentage return remains identical. This is why value investors analyze each share as if they were buying the entire company.

## Why is Stock Investing So Lucrative?

Stock investing can be particularly rewarding because:

1. **Many investors trade on emotion rather than fundamentals**. This creates mispricing opportunities.

2. **Most people struggle to understand large numbers**. While people can easily determine if a $1 million valuation for an ice cream stand is absurd, they have trouble assessing if a $2 trillion valuation for a large corporation is reasonable.

3. **Market psychology creates buying and selling pressure** unrelated to fundamental value, providing opportunities for value investors.

## The Value Investor's Advantage

A value investor's edge comes from:

1. Analyzing businesses based on fundamentals, not emotions
2. Treating each share as a proportional piece of a real business
3. Understanding that market prices don't always reflect intrinsic value
4. Having the patience to wait for attractive valuations

By mastering these concepts, you can avoid the common trap of treating stocks as abstract betting chips and instead recognize them for what they truly are: ownership stakes in real businesses with real assets, liabilities, and earnings.
